					<p>A) In order to obtain a full refund for an order you must return all bottles of the order you wish to be refunded, be they empty, full or partially full back to our fulfilment center at the address listed below, within sixty (60) days since the order date. If the entirety of the order is not received and processed by our fulfilment center within 60 days since the order date, we will not issue your refund.

					<p>B) Along with your returned order you must clearly include details regarding your order, including (1) Your ClickBank Order ID (found in your order receipt), (2) Your Full Name, (3) Your Full Address where the shipment was received, (4) Your Email Address and (5) your Phone Number so that a member of our fulfilment center staff can clearly read and process your return. Contact our support team at <a href="mailto:contact@glucoclear.com">contact@glucoclear.com</a> if you need help retrieving this information.</p>
					<p>Failure to fully meet both refund requirements A) and B) above will result in our inability to refund you. The customer must pay for the shipping to return the products to us.
